# FitTrack Labs – React Web App

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the completed work for **Programming Labs 1–3** as part of the **Capstone Project Management Assignment 1**. The project demonstrates foundational web development skills through HTML/CSS, React.js, and API interaction. The end product is a simple fitness-themed React application featuring a homepage, a profile page, and a functional Todo List that mimics real-world data interaction.

## 🧪 Lab Breakdown

### 💡 Programming Lab 1: HTML + CSS Static Website

**Objective:**  
Create a multi-page website using core HTML elements and CSS for styling.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- Developed `index.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html` pages with semantic HTML.
- Applied consistent styling via `styles.css`, including layout, colors, and responsive elements.
- Added navigation across all pages.
- Hosted using GitHub Pages (or local preview).

📁 Files:
- `/index.html`  
- `/about.html`  
- `/contact.html`  
- `/styles.css`  

✅ *All files include inline comments to explain structure and styling choices.*



Due to GitHub Pages deployment requirements, **Lab 1 (static HTML/CSS site)** is also hosted in a **separate repository**:

### ⚛️ Programming Lab 2: React App & Routing

**Objective:**  
Set up a React project with interactive components and page routing.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- Used `create-react-app` to initialize the project.
- Built `Home.js` and `Profile.js` components with basic content and styling.
- Implemented event handling and state management (`useState`, `useRef`) in `Home.js`.
- Used `react-router-dom` to create a simple SPA with routes `/` and `/profile`.

📁 Key Files:
- `/src/App.js`  
- `/src/Home.js`  
- `/src/Profile.js`  

✅ *Inline comments describe JSX structure, React hooks, and routing logic.*

### 🧩 Programming Lab 3: Todo List + API + State

**Objective:**  
Use API calls and React state to build a dynamic Todo List.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- Built `TodoList.js` with CRUD-style logic.
- Used `fetchTodos()` mock API to simulate data fetching on mount (`useEffect`).
- Implemented `TodoItem.js` with checkbox toggle and delete logic.
- Supported adding new todos via `prompt()` and `Date.now()` ID generation.
- Demonstrated debugging through console logs and simple error handling.

📁 Key Files:
- `/src/TodoList.js`  
- `/src/TodoItem.js`  
- `/src/api.js` *(mocked API fetch)*  

✅ *All components are fully commented to indicate how they fulfill Lab 3 requirements.*

## 📄 Written Reflection (PDF Submission Summary)

As part of Milestone 1, the following topics have been addressed in the accompanying PDF:

1. **Self-evaluation** in:
   - Programming: Intermediate
   - Database Systems: Beginner
   - User Interface Design: Intermediate
   - Business Analysis: Intermediate
   - Project Management: Beginner

2. **Real-world business problem:**
   > Many users struggle to maintain consistency with daily health tracking. FitTrack addresses this with a simple, focused interface that encourages habit formation through task management and visual reinforcement.

3. **Value creation:**
   > This project lowers barriers to entry for personal fitness tracking. It promotes usability over complexity, allowing users to focus on behavior, not tools.

4. **Technology trends comparison:**
   - React-based SPAs dominate front-end frameworks due to reusable components and virtual DOM.
   - Simple integrations with APIs provide dynamic, real-time experiences without back-end complexity.
   - The growing trend toward mobile-first and wellness-focused apps justifies the project context.

5. **Capstone project proposals:**
   - **Option 1:** Scalable version of FitTrack with cloud-hosted back-end and analytics dashboard.
   - **Option 2:** A meal-logging app that recommends healthy recipes and tracks nutritional intake.

## 💻 Repository Access & Deployment

- 🔗 **GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/sherry622tsy/Assignment1](https://github.com/sherry622tsy/Assignment1)
- ✅ Includes meaningful inline comments per lab requirement.
- ✅ Code is modular, version-controlled, and ready for expansion.

---

## 🧠 Reflection on Challenges & Fixes

### Challenges:
- Integrating routing without full back-end context.
- Managing state updates in `TodoList.js` without persistent storage.
- Styling conflicts between CSS and React components.

### Resolutions:
- Used `react-router-dom` v6 and focused on route-based rendering only.
- Managed local state with React hooks and scoped todos to session.
- Refined CSS to apply scoped class-based styles over global tags.
